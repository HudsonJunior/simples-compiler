# Simples Compiler

This project implements a basic compiler, developed in **C++**, to demonstrate compiler design fundamentals. The compiler parses and interprets simple expressions using a custom lexer and parser. This project covers key aspects of compiler theory, including:

- **Lexical Analysis**: Tokenizes input strings into lexical components.
- **Parsing**: Analyzes token sequences to ensure syntax validity.
- **Compilation**: Transforms parsed code into output (e.g., assembly-like language).

This project is designed for educational exploration of compiler principles.
